          <h2>Linking HTML to CSS</h2>
          <p>
            In order to link your html page to a style sheet, you have to use
            link element. Inside you will use the attribute "href" which will
            have the link or directory of your css and "rel" which should state
            the relation of the said linked document.

          <h2>Inline style</h2>
          <p>
            Inline styling is when you put syle inside the element/tag that you
            want to change/edit/put a syle on.
          </p>
          <aside style='color: rgb(0, 0, 255); font-size: 16px;'>
            This specific paragraph (aside elemet) is styled to have a
            font-color of blue. You can put style in an element by putting the
            attribute style and inside for example would be "style='color: red;
            font-size: 16px;'".

          <h2>Internal Stylsheet</h2>
          <p>
            In order to create an internal stylesheet you have to put the
            element inside the head of html. In this part, I italicized all the
            h2 elements inside the body for the articles.

          <h2>Universal</h2>
          <p>
            Universal selector "*" is used to resetting a default to set your
            own standard style for every element. Putting this ahead of your
            stylesheet is/should be a common practice.

          <h2>Selector Types</h2>
          <h4>Class Selectos</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'class="class-name"' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "." ahead of the class name ".class-name"
            is how you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Id Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'id="id-name"'' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "#" ahead of the id name "#id-name" is show
            you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Chaining Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selectors uses the set class and its element tag. For example
            "element-tag.class-name", in order to have a chaining selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Descendant Combinator</h4>
          <p>
            This selector is used when you want to select a certain part that
            also have nested elements inside. For example,
            ".class-name element-tag".
          </p>
          <h4>Multiple Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector can use multiple selectors all at once, you only have
            to put a comma right after a selector and put the next selector in
            the next line and put an indentation.
          </p>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: You can put multiple class in a single element if you have to.
            But you can only have a single id for each elements. IDs are the
            most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally,
            type.

        <article>
          <h2>Attribute</h2>
          <p>
            This selector uses attributes in order to style the elements it is
            nested on. In order to select attribute you enclose them in "[]"
            like [href]. You can also be more specific and instead use the
            element and its attribute like this "element[attribute*=value]",
            for example, "img[href*='link']".
          </p>

          <h2>Psuedo Class</h2>
          <p>
            This psuedo classes are used when you want to change the appearance
            of a specific element through interaction. There are different
            psudedo classes eg.(:focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active).
            You can apply this by using the tag and the psuedo class. For
            example: "tag:psuedo-class".
          </p>

          <h2>Visual Rules</h2>
          <h4>Fonts</h4>
          <h5>Font Family/Typeface</h5>
          <p>
            This property is used to change the font on the page you are
            developing. In order to use this, you must simply type
            "font-family: 'font-name'".
          </p>
          <h5>Font Size</h5>
          <p>
            In order to change the font size to your preferences, simply type
            "font-size: number-size|unit"
          </p>
          <h5>Font Weight</h5>
          <p>
            Font weight is exclusive to how bold you want your text to be. You
            can adjust this by inserting a parenthesis and a value inside it.
            For example: "font-weight= bold(value)"
          </p>
          <h4>Text-Align</h4>
          <p>
            This property aligns your text to your preference. There are left,
            right, and center alignment. There is also a justify value, which
            spaces out yout text from left to right of the parent element.
          </p>
          <h4>Color and Background Color</h4>
          <p>
            First, clear distinction between Color and Background Color, color
            referes to the foreground color which is the text and background
            color is exclusive only to the space occupied by the element you
            that you are styling. Likeso: "color: rgb(value, value, value);",
            "background-color: rgb(value, value, value):"
          </p>
          <h4>Opacity</h4>
          <p>
            This property is used to style how visible you want your content to
            be. For example: opacity = 1 is the default, which is why the value
            ranges from 1 to 0."as much small value as you want".
          </p>
          <h4>Background Image</h4>
          <p>
            Besides background color, you can also have an image as your
            background. For example: "background-image: url('image-link.com');".
          </p>
          <h4>Important</h4>
          <p>
            "!important" is a property that can be applied to any element.
            This should not be used unless necessary, this will override any
            set style on other elements if not specified.

          <h2>Box Model</h2>
          <p>
            The box model has a lot of properties that will dictate how your
            element will look.
          </p>

          <h4>Properties<h4>
          <ul class="box-model-properties">
            <li>
              "width" and "height" - The width and height of the content area.
            </li>
            <li>
              "padding" - The amount of space between the content area and the
              border.
            </li>
            <li>
              border - The thickness and style of the border surrounding the
              content area and padding.
            </li>
            <li>
              margin - The amount of space between the border and the outside
              edge of the element. Setting the margin to "0 auto" sets the divs
              inside its contatining elements to center and a 0 margin
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Margin Collapse</h4>
          <figure>
            <a href="http://localhost/CSS-lessons/margin-collapse.png"

          </figure>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: There is a thing called padding-shorthand. This is used to
            set padding on specific sides. These are padding-top, padding-right
            padding-bottom, and padding-left. There is also a thing called
            margin-shorthand. This is used to set margin on specific sides too.
            The property works similarly to the padding property.
          </aside>
          <h4>Minimum and Maximum</h4>
          <p>
            Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing
            screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those
            changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties
            that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized
            to. You can set both height and width to minimum and maximum value.
          </p>
          <h4>Overflow</h4>
          <p>
            The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills,
            or overflows, outside its box. The most commonly used values are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              hidden — when set to this value, any content that overflows will
              be hidden from view.
            </li>
            <li>
              scroll—when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the
              element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by
              scrolling.
            </li>
            <li>
              visible—when set to this value, the overflow content will be
              displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the
              default value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Resetting Defaults</h4>
          <p>
            All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the
            absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are
            known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term user agent
            is a technical term for the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set
            default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser
            displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer
            to design or style a web page.
          </p>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: When these properties are set to 0, they do not require a
            unit of measurement.
          </aside>
          <h4>Visibility</h4>
          <p>
            Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. The
            visibility property can be set to one of the following values:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            hidden — hides an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            visible — displays an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            collapse — collapses an element.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Border Box</h4>
          <p>
            The default value of "box-sizing" is content-box, setting it to
            border-box value will let your height and width be set to a fix
            value whether you add padding and/or margins.
          </p>

          <h2>Display and Positioning</h2>
          <h4>Position</h4>
          <h5>Position: Relative</h5>
          <p>
            This value allows you to position an element relative to its
            default static position on the web page. This is done by
            accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the
            following offset properties that will move the element away from
            its default static position:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            top - moves the element down from the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).
          </li>
          <li>
            right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Position: Absolute</h5>
          <p>
            When an element’s position is set to absolute, all other elements
            on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present
            on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest
             positioned parent element, while offset properties can be used to
             determine the final position from there.
           </p>
           <h5>Position: Fixed</h5>
           <p>
             We can fix an element to a specific position on the page
             (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed,
             and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top,
             bottom, left, and right. This technique is often used for
             navigation bars on a web page.
           </p>
           <h5>Position: Sticky</h5>
           <p>
             The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element
             in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a
             specified position as the page is scrolled further. This is done
             by using the sticky value along with the familiar offset
             properties, as well as one new one.
           </p>
           <h4>Z - Index</h4>
           <p>
             The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an
             element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This
             can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements
             appearing behind shallower elements. The z-index property accepts
