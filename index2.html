          <h2>Linking HTML to CSS</h2>
          <p>
            In order to link your html page to a style sheet, you have to use
            link element. Inside you will use the attribute "href" which will
            have the link or directory of your css and "rel" which should state
            the relation of the said linked document.
          </p>

              braces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Declaration - the property name and the value.
            </li>
            <li>
              Property - the first part of the declaration, the visual
              characteristic name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Value - second part of declaration, the value of the property.

          <h2>Inline style</h2>
          <p>
            Inline styling is when you put syle inside the element/tag that you
            want to change/edit/put a syle on.
          </p>
          <aside style='color: rgb(0, 0, 255); font-size: 16px;'>
            This specific paragraph (aside elemet) is styled to have a
            font-color of blue. You can put style in an element by putting the
            attribute style and inside for example would be "style='color: red;
            font-size: 16px;'".

          <h2>Internal Stylsheet</h2>
          <p>
            In order to create an internal stylesheet you have to put the
            element inside the head of html. In this part, I italicized all the
            h2 elements inside the body for the articles.

          <h2>Universal</h2>
          <p>
            Universal selector "*" is used to resetting a default to set your
            own standard style for every element. Putting this ahead of your
            stylesheet is/should be a common practice.
          </p>

          <h2>Selector Types</h2>
          <h4>Class Selectos</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'class="class-name"' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "." ahead of the class name ".class-name"
            is how you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Id Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'id="id-name"'' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "#" ahead of the id name "#id-name" is show
            you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Chaining Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selectors uses the set class and its element tag. For example
            "element-tag.class-name", in order to have a chaining selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Descendant Combinator</h4>
          <p>
            This selector is used when you want to select a certain part that
            also have nested elements inside. For example,
            ".class-name element-tag".
          </p>
          <h4>Multiple Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector can use multiple selectors all at once, you only have
            to put a comma right after a selector and put the next selector in
            the next line and put an indentation.
          </p>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: You can put multiple class in a single element if you have to.
            But you can only have a single id for each elements. IDs are the
            most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally,
            type.
          </aside>

        <article>
          <h2>Attribute</h2>
          <p>
            This selector uses attributes in order to style the elements it is
            nested on. In order to select attribute you enclose them in "[]"
            like [href]. You can also be more specific and instead use the
            element and its attribute like this "element[attribute*=value]",
            for example, "img[href*='link']".
          </p>

          <h2>Psuedo Class</h2>
          <p>
            This psuedo classes are used when you want to change the appearance
            of a specific element through interaction. There are different
            psudedo classes eg.(:focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active).
            You can apply this by using the tag and the psuedo class. For
            example: "tag:psuedo-class".
          </p>
          <aside class="comment-reference">

          <h2>Visual Rules</h2>
          <h4>Fonts</h4>
          <h5>Font Family/Typeface</h5>
          <p>
            This property is used to change the font on the page you are
            developing. In order to use this, you must simply type
            "font-family: 'font-name'".
          </p>
          <h5>Font Size</h5>
          <p>
            In order to change the font size to your preferences, simply type
            "font-size: number-size|unit"
          </p>
          <h5>Font Weight</h5>
          <p>
            Font weight is exclusive to how bold you want your text to be. You
            can adjust this by inserting a parenthesis and a value inside it.
            For example: "font-weight= bold(value)"
          </p>
          <h4>Text-Align</h4>
          <p>
            This property aligns your text to your preference. There are left,
            right, and center alignment. There is also a justify value, which
            spaces out yout text from left to right of the parent element.
          </p>
          <h4>Color and Background Color</h4>
          <p>
            First, clear distinction between Color and Background Color, color
            referes to the foreground color which is the text and background
            color is exclusive only to the space occupied by the element you
            that you are styling. Likeso: "color: rgb(value, value, value);",
            "background-color: rgb(value, value, value):"
          </p>
          <h4>Opacity</h4>
          <p>
            This property is used to style how visible you want your content to
            be. For example: opacity = 1 is the default, which is why the value
            ranges from 1 to 0."as much small value as you want".
          </p>
          <h4>Background Image</h4>
          <p>
            Besides background color, you can also have an image as your
            background. For example: "background-image: url('image-link.com');".
          </p>
          <h4>Important</h4>
          <p>
            "!important" is a property that can be applied to any element.
            This should not be used unless necessary, this will override any
            set style on other elements if not specified.

          <h2>Box Model</h2>
          <p>
            The box model has a lot of properties that will dictate how your
            element will look.
          </p>

          <h4>Properties<h4>
          <ul class="box-model-properties">
            <li>
              "width" and "height" - The width and height of the content area.
            </li>
            <li>
              "padding" - The amount of space between the content area and the
              border.
            </li>
            <li>
              border - The thickness and style of the border surrounding the
              content area and padding.
            </li>
            <li>
              margin - The amount of space between the border and the outside
              edge of the element. Setting the margin to "0 auto" sets the divs
              inside its contatining elements to center and a 0 margin
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Margin Collapse</h4>
          <figure>
            <a href="http://localhost/CSS-lessons/margin-collapse.png"

          </figure>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: There is a thing called padding-shorthand. This is used to
            set padding on specific sides. These are padding-top, padding-right
            padding-bottom, and padding-left. There is also a thing called
            margin-shorthand. This is used to set margin on specific sides too.
            The property works similarly to the padding property.
          </aside>
          <h4>Minimum and Maximum</h4>
          <p>
            Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing
            screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those
            changes in size. To avoid this problem, CSS offers two properties
            that can limit how narrow or how wide an element’s box can be sized
            to. You can set both height and width to minimum and maximum value.
          </p>
          <h4>Overflow</h4>
          <p>
            The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills,
            or overflows, outside its box. The most commonly used values are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              hidden — when set to this value, any content that overflows will
              be hidden from view.
            </li>
            <li>
              scroll—when set to this value, a scrollbar will be added to the
              element’s box so that the rest of the content can be viewed by
              scrolling.
            </li>
            <li>
              visible—when set to this value, the overflow content will be
              displayed outside of the containing element. Note, this is the
              default value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Resetting Defaults</h4>
          <p>
            All major web browsers have a default stylesheet they use in the
            absence of an external stylesheet. These default stylesheets are
            known as user agent stylesheets. In this case, the term user agent
            is a technical term for the browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set
            default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser
            displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer
            to design or style a web page.
          </p>
          <aside class="article-notes">
            Note: When these properties are set to 0, they do not require a
            unit of measurement.
          </aside>
          <h4>Visibility</h4>
          <p>
            Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. The
            visibility property can be set to one of the following values:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            hidden — hides an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            visible — displays an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            collapse — collapses an element.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Border Box</h4>
          <p>
            The default value of "box-sizing" is content-box, setting it to
            border-box value will let your height and width be set to a fix
            value whether you add padding and/or margins.

          <h2>Display and Positioning</h2>
          <h4>Position</h4>
          <h5>Position: Relative</h5>
          <p>
            This value allows you to position an element relative to its
            default static position on the web page. This is done by
            accompanying the position declaration with one or more of the
            following offset properties that will move the element away from
            its default static position:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            top - moves the element down from the top.
          </li>
          <li>
            bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.
          </li>
          <li>
            left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).
          </li>
          <li>
            right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h5>Position: Absolute</h5>
          <p>
            When an element’s position is set to absolute, all other elements
            on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present
            on the page. The element will be positioned relative to its closest
             positioned parent element, while offset properties can be used to
             determine the final position from there.
           </p>
           <h5>Position: Fixed</h5>
           <p>
             We can fix an element to a specific position on the page
             (regardless of user scrolling) by setting its position to fixed,
             and accompanying it with the familiar offset properties top,
             bottom, left, and right. This technique is often used for
             navigation bars on a web page.
           </p>
           <h5>Position: Sticky</h5>
           <p>
             The sticky value is another position value that keeps an element
             in the document flow as the user scrolls, but sticks to a
             specified position as the page is scrolled further. This is done
             by using the sticky value along with the familiar offset
             properties, as well as one new one.
           </p>
           <h4>Z - Index</h4>
           <p>
             The z-index property controls how far back or how far forward an
             element should appear on the web page when elements overlap. This
             can be thought of as the depth of elements, with deeper elements
             appearing behind shallower elements. The z-index property accepts
             integer values. Depending on their values, the integers instruct
             the browser on the order in which elements should be layered on
             the web page.
           </p>
           <h4>
             Displays
           </h4>
           <h5>
             Display: Inline
           </h5>
           <p>
             Inline displays are elements that does not take up the whole width
             of the page/screen.
           </p>
           <h5>
             Display: Block
           </h5>
           <p>
             Display block makes it so that anything that
             has this property will take up the whole width of the page.
           </p>
           <h5>
             Display: Inline-Block
           </h5>
           <p>
             Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block
             elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and
             we can specify their dimensions using the width and height
             properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block
             elements.
           </p>
           <h4>
             Float
           </h4>
           <p>
             The float property is commonly used for wrapping text around an
             image. Note, however, that moving elements left or right for
             layout purposes is better suited for tools like CSS grid and
             flexbox, which you’ll learn about later on.
           </p>
           <p>
             The float property can also be used to float multiple elements at
             once. However, when multiple floated elements have different
             heights, it can affect their layout on the page. Specifically,
             elements can “bump” into each other and not allow other elements
             to properly move to the left or right. The clear property
             specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each
             other on the page. It can take on one of the following values:
           </p>
           <ul>
           <li>
             left—the left side of the element will not touch any other element
             within the same containing element.
           </li>
           <li>
             right—the right side of the element will not touch any other
             element within the same containing element.
           </li>
           <li>
             both—neither side of the element will touch any other element
             within the same containing element.
           </li>
           <li>
             none—the element can touch either side.
           </li>
           </ul>

          <h2>Introduction to Colors</h2>
          <h4>Foreground vs Background</h4>
          <p>
            Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. For
            example, when a heading is styled to appear green, the foreground
            color of the heading has been styled. In CSS, these two design
            aspects can be styled with the following two properties:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>
            color - this property styles an element’s foreground color.
          </li>
          <li>
            background-color - this property styles an element’s background
            color.
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Hexadecimal</h4>
          <p>
            One syntax that we can use to specify colors is called hexadecimal.
            Colors specified using this system are called hex colors. A hex
            color begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by three
            or six characters. The characters represent values for red, blue
            and green. You can include hex colors just as you would include
            named colors: background-color: #9932cc;, and the letters can be
            uppercase or lowercase.
          </p>
          <h4>RGB Colors</h4>
          <p>
            “RGB value” or just “RGB”, that uses decimal numbers rather than
            hexadecimal numbers. Each of the three values represents a color
            component, and each can have a decimal number value from 0 to 255.
            The first number represents the amount of red, the second is green,
            and the third is blue. These colors are exactly the same as hex,
            but with a different syntax and a different number system.
          </p>
          <h4>Hue, Saturation, and Lightness</h4>
          <p>
            The syntax for HSL is similar to the decimal form of RGB, though it
            differs in important ways. The first number represents the degree
            of the hue, and can be between 0 and 360. The second and third
            numbers are percentages representing saturation and lightness
            respectively. Here is an example, "color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);".
          </p>
          <h5>Hue</h5>
          <p>
            Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel.
            Red is 0 degrees, Green is 120 degrees, Blue is 240 degrees, and
            then back to Red at 360.
          </p>
          <h5>Saturation</h5>
          <p>
            Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. The
            saturation increases towards 100% as the color becomes richer. The
            saturation decreases towards 0% as the color becomes grayer.
          </p>
          <h5>Lightness</h5>
          <p>
            Lightness refers to how light or dark the color is. Halfway, or
            50%, is normal lightness. Imagine a sliding dimmer on a light
            switch that starts halfway. Sliding the dimmer up towards 100%
            makes the color lighter, closer to white. Sliding the dimmer down
            towards 0% makes the color darker, closer to black.
          </p>
          <h5>Opacity and Alpha</h5>
          <p>
            To use opacity in the HSL color scheme, use hsla instead of hsl,
            and four values instead of three. Alpha is a decimal number from
            zero to one. If alpha is zero, the color will be completely
            transparent. If alpha is one, the color will be opaque. The value
            for half-transparent would be 0.5.
          </p>

          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <h4>Font-family</h4>
          <p>
            When specifying a typeface with multiple words, like Times New
            Roman, it is recommended to use quotation marks (' ') to group the
            words together.
          </p>
          <h5>Serif and Sans Serif</h5>
          <p>
            You may be wondering what features make a font similar to another
            font. The fonts Caslon, Georgia, and Times New Roman are Serif
            fonts. Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of each letter,
            as opposed to Sans-Serif fonts, which do not have the extra
            details.
          </p>
          <h4>Font-weight</h4>
          <p>
            The font weight property can take up values like ligher, normal,
            bold, and bolder. Numerical values can range from 1 (lightest) to
            1000 (boldest), but it is common practice to use increments of
            100. A font weight of 400 is equal to the keyword value normal,
            and a font weight of 700 is equal to bold.
          </p>
          <h4>Font-style</h4>
          <p>
            You can also italicize text with the font-style property. The
            italic value causes text to appear in italics. The font-style
            property also has a normal value which is the default.
          </p>
          <h4>Text-transformation</h4>
          <p>
            Text can also be styled to appear in either all uppercase or
            lowercase with the text-transform property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on the type of content a web page displays, it may make
            sense to always style a specific element in all uppercase or
            lowercase letters. For example, a website that reports breaking
            news may decide to format all h1 heading elements such that they
            always appear in all uppercase, as in the example above. It would
            also avoid uppercase text in the HTML file, which could make code
            difficult to read.
          </p>
          <h4>Text Layout</h4>
          <h5>Letter Spacing<h5>
          <p>
            The letter-spacing property is used to set the horizontal spacing
            between the individual characters in an element. It’s not common to
            set the spacing between letters, but it can sometimes help the
            readability of certain fonts or styles. The letter-spacing property
            takes length values in units, such as 2px or 0.5em.
          </p>
          <h5>Word Spacing</h5>
          <p>
            You can set the space between words with the word-spacing property.
            It’s also not common to increase the spacing between words, but it
            may help enhance the readability of bolded or enlarged text. The
            word-spacing property also takes length values in units, such as
            3px or 0.2em.
          </p>
          <h5>Line Height</h5>
          <p>
            We can use the line-height property to set how tall we want each
            line containing our text to be. Line height values can be a
            unitless number, such as 1.2, or a length value, such as 12px, 5%
            or 2em.
          </p>
          <h5>Text Alignment</h5>
          <p>
            The text-align property, aligns text to its parent element. The
            usual value set is left but there is also justify which spreads
            out the words.
          </p>
          <h4>Web Fonts using LINK</h4>
          <p>
            - Online font services, like Google Fonts, make it easy to find and
            link to fonts from your site. You can browse and select fonts that
            match the style of your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            - When you select a font in Google Fonts, you’ll be shown all of
            the different styles available for that particular font. You can
            then select the styles you want to use on your site.
          </p>
          <p>
            - When you’re done selecting a font and its styles, you can review
            your selected font family, and a link element will be
            automatically generated for you to use on your site!
          </p>
          <p>
            - The generated link element needs to be added to the head element
            in your HTML document for it to be ready to be used in your CSS.
          </p>
          <h4>Web Fonts using @font-face</h4>
          <p>
            Fonts can also be added using a @font-face ruleset in your CSS
            stylesheet instead of using a link element in your HTML document.
            As mentioned earlier, fonts can be downloaded just like any other
            file on the web. They come in a few different file formats, such
            as:
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>OTF (OpenType Font)</li>
          <li>TTF (TrueType Font)</li>
          <li>WOFF (Web Open Font Format)</li>
          <li>WOFF2 (Web Open Font Format 2)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The different formats are a progression of standards for how fonts
            will work with different browsers, with WOFF2 being the most
            progressive. It’s a good idea to include TTF, WOFF, and WOFF2
            formats with your @font-face rule to ensure compatibility on all
            browsers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the “Selected Families” section, you can use the “Download”
            button to download the font files to your computer. The files will
           be downloaded in a single format, in this case, TTF. You can use
           additional tools to generate additional file types for WOFF and
           WOFF2, check out MDN’s list of font generators for more information.
           When you have the files you need, move them to a folder inside your
           website’s working directory, and you’re ready to use them in a
           @font-face ruleset!

          <h2>Flexbox</h2>
          <h4>display: flex</h4>
          <p>
            Any element can be a flex container. Flex containers are helpful
            tools for creating websites that respond to changes in screen
            sizes. Child elements of flex containers will change size and
            location in response to the size and position of their parent
            container. For an element to become a flex container, its display
            property must be set to flex.
          </p>
          <h4>inline-flex</h4>
          <p>
            If we didn’t want div elements to be block-level elements, we would
            use display: inline. Flexbox, however, provides the inline-flex
            value for the display property, which allows us to create flex
            containers that are also inline elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we change the value of the display property to inline-flex,
            the divs will display inline with each other if the page is wide
            enough. If the parent element is too small, the flex items will
            shrink to accommodate the parent container’s size.
