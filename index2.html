          <h2>Linking stylesheetes</h2>
          <p>
            In order to link your html page to a style sheet, you have to use
            link element. Inside you will use the attribute "href" which will
            have the link or directory of your css and "rel" which should state
            the relation of the said linked document.

            Inline styling is when you put syle inside the element/tag that you
            want to change/edit/put a syle on.

          <aside style='color: rgb(0, 0, 255); font-size: 16px;'>
            This specific paragraph (aside elemet) is styled to have a
            font-color of blue. You can put style in an element by putting the
            attribute style and inside for example would be "style='color: red;
            font-size: 16px;'".

          <h2>Internal Stylsheets</h2>
          <p>
            In order to create an internal stylesheet you have to put the
            element inside the head of html. In this part, I italicized all the
            h2 elements inside the body for the articles.

          <h2>Universal Standard</h2>
          <p>
            Universal selector "*" is used to resetting a default to set your
            own standard style for every element. Putting this ahead of your
            stylesheet is/should be a common practice.

          <h2>Class and Id Selectors</h2>
          <h4>Class Selectos</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'class="class-name"' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "." ahead of the class name ".class-name"
            is how you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Id Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector uses the set 'id="id-name"'' in order to style a
            specific part. Putting a "#" ahead of the id name "#id-name" is show
            you create the selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Chaining Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selectors uses the set class and its element tag. For example
            "element-tag.class-name", in order to have a chaining selector.
          </p>
          <h4>Descendant Combinator</h4>
          <p>
            This selector is used when you want to select a certain part that
            also have nested elements inside. For example,
            ".class-name element-tag".
          </p>
          <h4>Multiple Selectors</h4>
          <p>
            This selector can use multiple selectors all at once, you only have
            to put a comma right after a selector and put the next selector in
            the next line and put an indentation.
          </p>
          <aside>
            Note: You can put multiple class in a single element if you have to.
            But you can only have a single id for each elements. IDs are the
            most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally,
            type.

        <article>
          <h2>Attribute Selectors</h2>
          <p>
            This selector uses attributes in order to style the elements it is
            nested on. In order to select attribute you enclose them in "[]"
            like [href]. You can also be more specific and instead use the
            element and its attribute like this "element[attribute*=value]",
            for example, "img[href*='link']".
          </p>

          <h4>Fonts</h4>
          <h5>Font Family/Typeface</h5>
          <p>
            This property is used to change the font on the page you are
            developing. In order to use this, you must simply type
            "font-family: 'font-name'".

          </p>
          <h5>Font Weight</h5>
          <p>
            Font weight is exclusive to how bold you want your text to be. You
            can adjust this by inserting a parenthesis and a value inside it.
            For example: "font-weight= bold(value)"
          </p>
          <h4>Text-Align</h4>
          <p>
            This property aligns your text to your preference. There are left,
            right, and center alignment. There is also a justify value, which
            spaces out yout text from left to right of the parent element.
          </p>
          <h4>Color and Background Color</h4>
          <p>
            First, clear distinction between Color and Background Color, color
            referes to the foreground color which is the text and background
            color is exclusive only to the space occupied by the element you
            that you are styling. Likeso: "color: rgb(value, value, value);",

          </p>
          <h4>Opacity</h4>
          <p>
            This property is used to style how visible you want your content to
            be. For example: opacity = 1 is the default, which is why the value
            ranges from 1 to 0."as much small value as you want".
          </p>
          <h4>Background Image</h4>
          <p>
            Besides background color, you can also have an image as your
            background. For example: "background-image: url('image-link.com');".

          <p>
            "!important" is a property that can be applied to any element.
            This should not be used unless necessary, this will override any
            set style on other elements if not specified.
