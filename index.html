      You cannot grasp water, but it is inside a soil
      You cannot touch fire, but it is inside a tree
      You cannot hold wind, but it is resting on the rock
      If you let them be, they will exist everywhere
      </p>
      <p style='color: green'>
      The faint blue light, makes me sigh 
      My white breath, turned into snow and tears
      I could not let them drop and hid them
      Despite knowing that they will fill up once again
      </p>
      <p id='last-line'>
      I am a fool who dares not shed a single tear
      </p>
