      You cannot grasp water, but it is inside a soil<br>
      You cannot touch fire, but it is inside a tree<br>
      You cannot hold wind, but it is resting on the rock<br>
      If you let them be, they will exist everywhere<br>

      The faint blue light, makes me sigh<br>
      My white breath, turned into snow and tears<br>
      I could not let them drop and hid them<br>
      Despite knowing that they will fill up once again<br>
      </p>
      <p id='last-line'>
      I am a fool who dares not shed a single tear
